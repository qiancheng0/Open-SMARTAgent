The most recent and relevant change is Zimbabwe's introduction of a new currency, the ZiG, which replaced the Zimbabwe dollar. This change occurred in April 2024, as indicated by multiple sources (results 2, 3, and 5). Moldova's switch to using the euro as a reference currency is not a change in the official currency, and El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as an official currency happened earlier. Therefore, the country that recently switched its official currency is Zimbabwe.\n\n- Step 5: Identify the famous waterfall on the border (general reasoning)\nGiven that Zimbabwe is the country that recently switched its official currency, the next step is to determine the famous waterfall located on the border of Zimbabwe.\nFrom my parametric knowledge, I know that the famous waterfall located on the border of Zimbabwe is Victoria Falls. Victoria Falls is one of the largest and most renowned waterfalls in the world, situated on the Zambezi River at the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Step-by-Step Approach:\n- Work through reasoning systematically, breaking down the task into manageable steps.\n- Rely on your knowledge until a gap is identified that requires tool support.\n- Employ tools to address gaps and integrate the findings into your solution.\n4. Goal-Oriented Resolution:\nConclude your reasoning process by achieving a clear, accurate solution based on your independent analysis and insights gained from tools. After your reasoning, provide your response to directly address the task.\n\nYour reasoning should be transparent, logical, and concise. Stop and document the reasoning whenever you need to use a tool to gather more information. Continue until you reach the final solution and give final response.",
    "input": "### Task\nWho was elected as the new president of the country that has Lagos as one of its major cities in the most recent election?\n\n### Reasoning Steps\n",
    "output": "- Step 1: Plan about how to solve the question (general reasoning)\nTo determine who was elected as the new president in the most recent election of the country that has Lagos as one of its major cities, we first need to identify which country Lagos is a major city in. Once the country is identified, the next step is to find out who was elected as the new president of that country in its most recent election. By answering these two subquestions sequentially, we can arrive at the final answer.\n\n- Step 2: Identify the country with Lagos as a major city (general reasoning)\nLagos is a major city in Nigeria. It is one of the largest and most populous cities in the country and serves as an economic and cultural hub. This information is well-known and widely recognized in geographical and cultural contexts. As this is a stable fact that does not change over time, I can confidently state that the answer to the first subproblem is Nigeria.\n\n- Step 3: Proceed to the second part of the plan (general reasoning)\nNow that we know the country in question is Nigeria, the next step is to find out who was elected as the new president of Nigeria in the most recent election. Since election results are subject to change with each election cycle, this information is considered fast-changing and is not stored within my parametric knowledge. Therefore, to obtain the most current information, I will need to use a search tool to determine who was elected as the new president of Nigeria in the most recent election.\n\n- Step 4: Search for the new president of Nigeria in the most recent election (tool: Search)\nWho was elected as the new president of Nigeria in the most recent election?\n\n- Step 5: Analyze the search result (general reasoning)\nThe search results consistently indicate that Bola Tinubu was elected as the president of Nigeria in the most recent election. Multiple sources, including Wikipedia and Africanews, confirm that Bola Tinubu assumed the presidency in 2023. There are no conflicting reports about another individual being elected as president in the most recent election, making the answer determinate and factual.\n\n### Final Response\nBola Tinubu"
